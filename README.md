# Assignment 6 - Quantum Espresso and ASE 

In this Assignment, you'll run DFT calculations with ASE. The scripts here will take you through running DFT on Si, 
where you'll build a model using ASE, perform a geometry optimisation, and work out the electronic density of states and band structure for Si. 

## Getting started 

Firstly, login to Aristotle via:

`ssh  ucxxxxx@aristotle.rc.ucl.ac.uk`

where ucxxxxx is your UCL username. 

In your home directory on Aristotle, clone the tutorial GitHub repository through: 

`git clone [https://github.com/UCL-DDMD/ASE-Tutorials/assessement.git](https://github.com/UCL-DDMD/ASE-assignment.git)`

To transfer files between your local machine and Aristotle run:

`scp -r ucxxxxx@aristotle.rc.ucl.ac.uk:path/to/your/file Desktop`

In this directory, you have a submission script for submitting jobs on Aristotle, Python scripts for running a geometry optimisaiton,
band structure, DOS calculation, and pseudopotentials. Instructions on how to complete and submit the assignment are in the NSCI0032: Integrated Data-Driven Materials Science and Digitalisation 23/24
page on Moodle.
